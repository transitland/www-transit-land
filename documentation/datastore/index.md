The Transitland Datastore brings together data from authoritative sources (listed in the [Feed Registry](/documentation/feed-registry/)) with contributions, edits, and fixes from transit enthusiasts and developers. It's a hosted service that provides a simple web API for query and editing.

The API uses a REST configuration and results are in a paginated JSON format. To get started with the Datastore and learn how to make queries, follow this [tutorial](/documentation/tutorial/index.md).
